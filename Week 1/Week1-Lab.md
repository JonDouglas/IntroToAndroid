# Week 1 Lab

## Description

Create an android application that wishes somebody special "Happy Birthday".

The application should use at least one `ImageView` and one `TextView`.

## Instructions

We learned earlier about the different types of `View` classes Android has to offer. You will be using your new knowledge to add a couple of views to a `XML` `Layout`.

### Modify the main layout

Inside of your `layout` folder, there will already be an `activity_main.xml` file. You can open up this file and add your two controls to the existing `ViewGroup` layout. By default the `ViewGroup` will be a `ConstraintLayout`.

### Specify the view attributes

Now that we have both of our views inside of our `ViewGroup`, we will want to add attributes until we are satisfied with our Birthday Card app.

**Hint:** Use attributes such as `android:text`, `android:src`, `android:layout_height`, and `android:layout_width` to accomplish this.
